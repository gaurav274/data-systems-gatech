We live in an era of unprecedented access to data. Our group tackles new challenges in organizing and leveraging the vast amounts of information at our disposal using data management and machine learning techniques. We participate in a number of cross-disciplinary research efforts, and closely collaborate with other groups at Georgia Tech.

The database group was the first research facility at Georgia Tech to be ranked by U.S. News & World Report in the 1990s. Our graduates have taken up faculty positions at top-ranked programs, including Rice, Texas A&M, and UIC. Our collaborators include IBM Almaden, HP Labs, Microsoft Research, and ATT. Our sponsors include NSF, NIH, DARPA, CDC, Intel, and IBM.
